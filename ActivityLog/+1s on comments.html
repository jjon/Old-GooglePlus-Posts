I am not saying that google needs to undo the red.  I am saying that they need to give us a choice. As for the sort, you and I appear to be seeing vastly different things, and since google doesn&#39;t give us a sort function that we can change, that is very odd. For me, under the classic view, posts were always in a pretty good approximation of chronological order.  I could start at the top and scan down, and once I had seen one or two posts that I was already familiar with I new that I was in &quot;old&quot; territory and I could stop scrolling.  Under the new mess, posts appear randomized with a slight chronological bias.  I have stuff 45min old buried under things a day and a half old, with no discernible reason why.  Even worse than that, I have posts I have seen appearing above posts that I haven&#39;t seen, meaning that I have no idea where the line of demarcation between &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;New&quot; lies. Both of them will re-shuffle if you refresh, but the old is a slight rearranging, while the new appears to be a full shuffle. If there is only going to be one choice, then that choice should be the most logical and utilitarian.  In this case, a strict chronological sort (withing the confines of a multi-server environment) If anything less utilitarian than that is going to be offered, then it needs to be offered as an option above and beyond the utilitarian.  — Links and images in g+ comments?<div class="footer"><span class="time" title="2016-10-25T18:36+0000">Oct 25, 2016, 6:36:23 PM</span><br><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113686253941057080055">Brian Rose</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111144236014563634825">Tom Scott</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108225064923553796327">evil witch</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114009972725847410857">Lee Grupsmith-Pedersen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106029910359400047659">Chris Weber</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105261209784057530090">Colin Jones</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111522003007603813028">Lisa Borel</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/100817211548713875249">Luke Wroblewski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115217353584593273093">Mati JZ</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108541497785634491568">Danielle Buckley</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102031339917242216525">Robin Stephens</a></div></div></div></div><div class="item"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YKosRpqVrlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADO0/1UyEi-ERjB0/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" target="_blank" class="media-link"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YKosRpqVrlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADO0/1UyEi-ERjB0/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" alt="Image" class="media"></a><div class="text"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+GuillaumeJanssen/posts/D64uon8Vmd4" class="item-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">+1'd comment on post by Guillaume Janssen in Spellbinding Music</a>Panic averted +Jon Crump :) they are such a great pair and I hope they record more too at some stage — [New Post] The Gloaming 2  Since the emergence of The Gloaming as a collective in 2011, Martin Hayes (fiddle), Dennis Cahill (guitar), Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh (Hardanger d’Amore), Iarla Ó Lionáird (voice) and Thomas Bartlett (piano) have captured the imagination of the audience worldwide, recently selling out Dublin’s National Concert Hall for five consecutive nights last February/March 2016.
