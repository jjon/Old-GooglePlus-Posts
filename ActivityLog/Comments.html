It&#39;s still music that I love and still listen to. — Depending on the context, it was either aeons ago, or seemingly just yesterday that I lived in Santa Cruz and made music as a member of a vocal quartet with my friends Debra Spencer, Merry Dennehy, and Clay Cambern, doing a mix of medieval, renaissance, and modern music. Thanks to some help from Bill Coulter, we made a recording in 1987 of some of our repertoire and, though it was a callow offering I&#39;m sure, I&#39;ve nevertheless long wanted to make that recording publicly available. Time passed and we all fell out of touch, and then, to my shock and sadness, news came to me several years late, that Clay had died untimely in 2011.  I&#39;ve now taken it upon myself to make that ancient recording available on the internet, in part because some of that repertoire, particularly the music from the Chigi Codex, is uncommon and uncommonly beautiful. My other aim, however, was to offer a tribute to the memory of our friend Clay who was very dear to us and fondly remembered by many in Santa Cruz.  So here&#39;s to you Clay, and to the fond memories of that bygone time.  http://goo.gl/uy9p4q<div class="footer"><span class="time" title="2016-05-05T05:38+0000">May 5, 2016, 5:38:20 AM</span><br><div class="visibility">Shared to the collection <a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/0T0sDB">Music I Like</a> - Private</div></div></div></div><div class="item"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YKosRpqVrlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADO0/1UyEi-ERjB0/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" target="_blank" class="media-link"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YKosRpqVrlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADO0/1UyEi-ERjB0/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" alt="Image" class="media"></a><div class="text"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+GuillaumeJanssen/posts/D64uon8Vmd4" class="item-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">Commented on post by Guillaume Janssen in Spellbinding Music</a>+Guillaume Janssen I worried about that too, but this year&#39;s tour schedule from martin&#39;s web-site would suggest that the duo continues to be a going concern: http://www.martinhayes.com/concerts — [New Post] The Gloaming 2  Since the emergence of The Gloaming as a collective in 2011, Martin Hayes (fiddle), Dennis Cahill (guitar), Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh (Hardanger d’Amore), Iarla Ó Lionáird (voice) and Thomas Bartlett (piano) have captured the imagination of the audience worldwide, recently selling out Dublin’s National Concert Hall for five consecutive nights last February/March 2016.

Thanks for that. — Bewitching! Trio Mediaeval (vocals) feat. Garth Knox (viola), Agnès Vesterman (cello) and Sylvain Lemêtre (percussion) - Just (after song of songs) - comp. David Lang From The Song of Songs (2015) http://www.louthcms.org/recordings/the-song-of-songs The song also features on the OST of Paolo Sorrentino’s film Youth/La Giovinezza (2015)  Composer note:   &quot;Just (after song of songs) is a setting of a text I made by finding certain things in the Song of Songs. The original text is of course the most passionate and erotic of the ancient Jewish books, and it is always strange to encounter it in the Bible. In 2008 I wrote a choral piece called for love is strong, in which I made a similar text from the Song of Songs, trying to use the words to see through the relationship between the man and the woman in the story to the relationship between Man and God. According to Jewish tradition the Song of Songs is a metaphor for our passion for the Eternal, so the words themselves become very important.   One thing that has always interested me about the text is that the man and the woman in the Song of Songs have attributes, they notice things about each other, they own things, they have features that are desirable. In a love between people this would be no surprise. In a love between Man and God, however, that might mean that in this text are clues to the nature of God&#39;s own attributes, and a record of how they might attract us.   For my text I listed everything personal or owned that is attributed to the man and to the woman. To clarify who is speaking I started every phrase of his with &quot;just your&quot; and every phrase of hers with &quot;and my.&quot; It is interesting that in a text about a love that is shared there are only seven instances of &quot;our&quot; David Lang http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/51986<div class="footer"><span class="time" title="2016-02-17T18:50+0000">Feb 17, 2016, 6:50:10 PM</span><br><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114575265115308036237">Adrian Horn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112762986375686595663">Oded Fried-Gaon</a></div></div></div></div><div class="item"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p1CCiLfo5ao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANo/YaF1LgxJwSU/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" target="_blank" class="media-link"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p1CCiLfo5ao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANo/YaF1LgxJwSU/w100-h100-n/photo.jpg" alt="Image" class="media"></a><div class="text"><a href="https://plus.google.com/103972079813616724001/posts/BfbyzoabQzy" class="item-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">Commented on post by Jon Crump</a>Thanks Joseph, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s right.

In particular, I loved the strong female character in Erina - rare for this genre I think. I also liked the detail in the action scenes (it seemed to raise the suspense and make every move of the action so clear), and Carter&#39;s strong voice and struggle. Underlying the fast-paced action are thoughtful and compelling ideas on spirituality, and the power of love and self-forgiveness.   “I learnt a lot in the first scenes about showing Carter&#39;s depth of character by his actions - how he reacts to the boy shows his compassion way more than being told/ or inner dialogue etc. This makes the reader empathise with him immediately, and with his personal struggle/weakness and ghost.” Pia Riley  “I am learning a lot from your book in terms of structure and technique (apart from being a good read).

You got further than I. But this sort of klugy hacking shouldn&#39;t be necessary.
