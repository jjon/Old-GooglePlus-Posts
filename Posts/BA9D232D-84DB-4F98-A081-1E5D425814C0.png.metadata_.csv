The Itinerary of King John & the Rotuli Litterarum Patentium.

Thanks to Janet Gillespie's generous gift of data, geographical coordinates and reference data on all of the sites appearing in Thomas D Hardy's 1835 ""Itinerary"" are now accessible from this dynamic timeline and map linked to scans of all the pages and indexes of the Rot. Lit. Pat.

The updated resource was recently noticed on the website of the British Association for local history: http://www.balh.org.uk/news/king-johns-mobile-phone-record.
